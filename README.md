##This Verilog-based PIPELINE PROCESSOR DESIGN project was developed using VS Code for coding, Icarus Verilog and GTKWave for simulation and waveform analysis, with ChatGPT assistance for code correction and debugging.

Project Title
Design and Simulation of a 4-Stage Pipelined Processor Using Verilog

Objective
To design and simulate a basic 4-stage pipelined processor capable of executing simple instructions like ADD, SUB, and LOAD. The pipeline stages include Instruction Fetch (IF), Instruction Decode (ID), Execution (EX), and Write Back (WB). The goal is to demonstrate instruction parallelism and improved throughput in a processor design using Verilog HDL.

Pipeline Stages
Stage	Name	Description
1	IF - Fetch	Fetch instruction from memory
2	ID - Decode	Decode instruction and prepare operands
3	EX - Execute	Perform ALU operations (ADD, SUB, etc.)
4	WB - Write Back	Store the result back to register file
